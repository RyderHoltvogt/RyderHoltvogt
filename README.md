Hi, I'm Ryder! I'm a passionate 16-year-old student with a deep fascination for robotics and aerospace engineering. I'm currently exploring the exciting world of building and programming robots, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for a future career in aerospace.

This repository showcases some of my current projects, which reflect my learning journey and growing skills.

Iâ€™m currently working on an autonomous robot that will be able to navigate with SLAM mapping with a 360 Lidar.
